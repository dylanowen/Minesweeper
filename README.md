# Minesweeper!

This isn't the minesweeper your grandma used to play, no sir. This is _Minesweeper!_ With two modes of play and a wraparound option, it offers a new challenge for beginning players and experts alike. If you've never played any kind of minesweeper game before, you'll probably want to start with Classic mode. If you're familiar with the basic rules, go ahead and try out Donut mode and the wraparound option.  Happy sweeping!

## System requirements
_Minesweeper!_ runs on Java.  If you don't have Java installed on your computer, you can download the **JRE** from Oracle's website: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
