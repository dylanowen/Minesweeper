		<h1>How to play Minesweeper!</h1>
		<p>
		This isn't the minesweeper your grandma used to play, no sir.  This is <b>Minesweeper</b>!  With two modes of play and a wraparound option, it offers a new challenge for beginning players and experts alike.  If you've never played any kind of minesweeper game before, you'll probably want to start with Classic mode.  If you're familiar with the basic rules, go ahead and read about Donut mode and the wraparound option.
		</p>
		<h1>Basic controls</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Left-click: clear a tile</li>
			<li>Right-click: cycle through placing a flag, placing a "?", and returning to a blank tile</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Note: when a flag is placed on a tile, you cannot left-click on it (it can't be cleared)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Space bar: toggle tile highlighting</li>
			<ul>
				<li>While hovering the mouse over a tile, you can highlight the neighboring cells.  This is especially helpful when using wraparounds.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h1>Classic mode</h1>
		<p>
		In Classic mode, some of the tiles have mines underneath them.  Your goal is to clear out all the "safe" tiles on the board without hitting any of the mines.  You can clear a tile by left-clicking on it to reveal the space underneath.  If you think a tile has a mine under it, you can right-click to place a flag on that tile.  Right-clicking twice replaces the flag with a "?", in case you aren't sure you want to flag it yet, and right-clicking a third time removes the "?".
